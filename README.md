# Mad Libs
This repository contains a project for Mr. Pettett's Zoom class. Inside the `Mad Libs Project` folder you will find a HTML, CSS, and JS file that will create a ~ugly~ *simple* website which will run a Mad Lib that I created.
## For The Uninitiated...
The concept behind Mad Lib game is quite simple. The core of the game is a story with many crucial words taken out and replaced with blanks. One player, the reader, tells the other players to fill in the blanks with words of the same part of speech. The catch is that only the reader knows the story--the other players are completely blind going in. For instance, the story might be:
```
"________ (EXCLAMATION)!" he yelled as he ________ (PAST TENSE VERB) into the convertible _________ (NOUN) and drove off with his ________ (ADJECTIVE) wife.
```
The other player(s) will then fill in the blanks with words of the same part of speech, so that the story may now read something like this:
```
"Yip!" he yelled as he slithered into the convertible Yoda and drove off with his non-existent wife.
```
After all the blanks have been filled, the reader reads the story out loud. The brilliant part about a Mad Lib is that, because the other players know nothing about the story, the story they create may be zany, weird, laugh-out-loud funny, confusing, or anything in between. Furthermore, every story is unique, based off who is "constructing" the story, what words these people provide to fill in the blanks, and the story that is completed. This unpredictability is what makes Mad Libs so enjoyable.
## How This Program Applies These Rules
This program fills the role of the reader. Upon being run, the website displays a series of blanks for the user to fill in. When all the blanks have been filled, the user presses the submit button and the website displays the story.
Currently, there is only one story to generate. This might or might not be improved on in the future.
### What Needs Done
I have no clue why in the world anyone would want to improve on a random project made by a random kid learning programming. But just in case you're a masochist (or if you're future me fixing the mistakes of the past), here is what you can do:
 - Fix a glitch that allows the player to complete the Mad Lib without filling in all the blanks. Although this is useful for testing purposes, it is an irritating reminder of my own lack of focus and diligence and I want it gone.
 - Add more stories, perhaps.
 - Clean up the JavaScript. I don't know if there is any way to avoid having a 1,250-character string in the code, but if there is, I will gladly take it over a big hunk of ugliness.

Thanks! \\(^w^\\)

 > "But we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you would do well to pay attention to as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts, knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes about by someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit." 2 Peter 1:19-21
